\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:limits}

\todo{This section should discuss the threats to validity of our experiments.}

\todo{One such threat is that the human-written type
  annotations might contain errors.}

\todo{This section should discuss the limitations of our approach, especially
  that we cannot infer polymorphic types at all.}

\todo{This section should discuss future work, especially any ideas we have about
  inferring polymorphic types.}

Inference results depend on uses in your program or test suite.
