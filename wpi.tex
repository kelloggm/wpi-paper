\begin{abstract}
  A pluggable type system extends a programming language with type qualifiers.
  It enables a programmer to write a type such as \<unsigned int>, \<secret
  string>, or \<nonnull object>.
  Type-checking with pluggable types detects and prevents more errors.
  The biggest obstacle to use of pluggable types is the need for
  programmers to write type qualifiers.
  Type inference can solve this problem.
  Traditional approaches to type inference are type-system-specific:
  build and then solve a system
  of constraints corresponding to the rules of the underlying type system.
  This approach does not scale well to pluggable type
  systems: for each new pluggable type system, the type inference algorithm
  must be extended to build and then solve constraints specific
  to that pluggable type system.

  We propose a novel type inference algorithm for pluggable type systems
  that is generic over the pluggable type system to which it is applied.
  That is, our system can infer type qualifiers for \emph{any} pluggable
  type system with no new\todo{This is a bit strong.  We do need custom
    code to deal with special cases (the framework has hooks for some of
    these), including non-qualifiers (declaration
    annotations, pre- and post-conditions.} type-system-specific code. The key insight behind
  our new technique is that extant, practical pluggable type systems are
  \emph{flow-sensitive}
  and therefore include \emph{local} type inference components. Our algorithm
  uses the results of local type inference to produce candidate summaries
  for procedures. These new summaries enable new local inference results
  elsewhere in the program---our algorithm runs until a fix-point in procedure
  summaries is reached.

  We have implemented our algorithm for the open-source Checker Framework
  project, which is widely used in industry and on which dozens of specialized pluggable typecheckers
  have been built. In experiments, with \todo{some number of} distinct
  pluggable typecheckers and \todo{some number of} projects, our algorithm
  inferred \todo{X}\% of the annotations that programmers wrote. We also compared our
  technique to other techniques for type inference.

\section{Conclusion}

\todo{This section concludes.}

%% In future work, we plan to develop
%% improved inference techniques for lightweight ownership annotations.  Since
%% these annotations can be added anywhere without impacting soundness (they
%% are verified, not trusted), genetic
%% search
%% and machine-learning techniques could be used to introduce them, using the
%% warnings emitted by \tool as the fitness function.
