  \caption{
    WPI performance on human-annotated benchmarks. ``Annotated for'' is
    the names of the typecheckers for which human annotations were written
    (see \cref{tab:checkers} to understand the codes).
    ``NCNB LoC'' is the number of lines of non-comment, non-blank code.
    ``Annos.'' is the number of human-written annotations, across all typecheckers.
    ``WPI \% Inferred'' is the percentage of the human-written annotations that WPI
    inferred.\todo{What if WPI inferred something weaker or stronger?  How
      does that count?}\todo{Does it make sense to measure precision as
      well as recall?}\todo{Does it make sense to record the number of
      type-checking errors?  I don't think so:  the number of wrong
      inferred annotations is a better measure of remaining human effort.}
