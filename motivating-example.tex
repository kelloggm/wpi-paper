\section{Motivating Example}
\label{sec:motivating-example}

\todo{This section should include a relatively simple motivating example
  for WPI, showing how WPI can infer types across method boundaries. Maybe
  use the Nullness Checker as the typechecker? The goal of the section is
  to give some intuition for the problem that we're solving
  before we dive into the core algorithm in the next section.}
