\subsection{Type Inference For Pluggable Type Systems}
\label{sec:rw:type-inference-pluggable}

Talk about specific type inference approaches for pluggable type systems, including those we
compared against in \cref{sec:comparison}. Probably also CASCADE.

\subsection{Type Inference Approaches}
\label{sec:rw:type-inference}

Talk about general type inference approaches, classic and modern.

\subsection{Pluggable Types}
\label{sec:pluggable}

Talk about other approaches to making type systems easier to use?

\todo{Any other general category of things I'm missing here?}

The best citation for Werner's work on WPI is \cite{XiangLD2020}.

Houdini also repeatedly runs a verification tool, until fixed point \cite{FlanaganJL01,FlanaganL2001:Houdini}.
