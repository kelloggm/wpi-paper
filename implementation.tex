\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We built it and it works. Say things about the Checker Framework. This section
should be pretty short; it might give some more details about how we solved
some of the theoretical problems we describe in \cref{sec:difficulties}?

\todo{In the camera-ready paper (when we are not anonymized), say
  that this has been publicly available and documented in the Checker
  Framework distribution since May 2, 2016.}
